## Your Tasks

1. **Generate a 5-day meal plan**  
   - For each of the selected meal types, generate a plan for 5 days.  
   - Meals may repeat daily for simplicity.  
   - Provide two distinct meal plans:
     - One for adults and children age 12 and up.
     - One for children under age 12.

2. **Use pantry items where possible**  
   - Prioritize using perishable fresh items before frozen or canned ones.  
   - Minimize waste by consuming what's already on hand.

3. **Output two precise lists:**
   - `Used Pantry Items`: List each ingredient used with exact name and quantity (e.g., `Broccoli florets, 2 cups`).
   - `Grocery List`: List each ingredient needed with **exact name and quantity**, formatted for use in a Walmart API or other online grocery integration (e.g., `Chicken breasts, 2 lbs`).

4. **Write a detailed step-by-step meal prep guide**  
   - Organize instructions by meal type (e.g., "All Breakfasts", "All Lunches").  
   - Include preparation time, portion sizes, and clear storage instructions (e.g., refrigerate, freeze, divide into containers).
   - Assume all meals will be prepped in advance and stored for the week.
